Starting Point:
        We started profiling with a working version of our UM assignment. The
        starting code works with all um tests includuing sandmark.

Acknowledgements:
        Comp40 TA's and instructors for teaching the material

Benchmarks:
        Midmark, Sandmark

Machine Used:
        Halligan 116e used to run tests.
        Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz

Resource Intensive Routine:
        Seq_get() takes up 21% of our performance according to KCachegrind. 
        Therefore our store and load calls take up the most resources since 
        they use Seq_get to retrieve memory segments.

        Of our Seq_get() calls, about 85% of them take place in the Store 
        and Load commands. Since Seq_get() is an outside function by hanson, 
        it is impossible for us to determine where we can improve the code,
        and thus there is no assembly code that can be deleted or changed 
        to improve timing.
