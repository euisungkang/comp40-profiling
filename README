Starting Point:
    We started profiling with a working version of our UM assignment. The
    starting code works with all um tests includuing sandmark.

Machine Used:
    Halligan 116e used to run tests.
    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz

Resource Intensive Routine:
    Seq_get() takes up 21% of our performance according to KCachegrind. 
    Therefore our store and load calls take up the most resources since they
    use Seq_get to retrieve memory segments.
    

Time Analyzing: 8 hours
