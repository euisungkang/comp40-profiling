UNBLACKEDGES

Please put answers to questions here.

  1. What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
     black edges?
      About 3/5 spent on I/O.
      2/5 for removing black edges
  
  2. How long does
  
        time ./unblackedges 
  
     take?
  
     0.014 seconds

  3. After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
     happened to the total time?

      0.010s
      The time it took to run the program reduced by 1/3 (0.33%)
  
  4. What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?

      It decreased very slightly. Approx. 0.04%

  
  5. Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
     changed?
  
      We've altered the data structure to use queues. Thus, the process
      requires less calls to memory to finish.
